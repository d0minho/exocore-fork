# a quick guide in creating an exocore

to begin you need things <ol>
1. github desktop 
2. vs codee
3. netlify account 

go to this <a href="https://github.com/Cmoneycodes/blank-EXOCORE">Link </a>. Click the green button that says use this template and fork as a new repo on the github webwsite. from there you can go on github desktop and clone the repo. once you have cloned the repo on your desktop you can right click the repo after opening it in <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">github desktop </a> and an option for open in vs code should appear. make sure to click that you trust the code when you enter in vs code. go to href="https://desktop.github.com/"><a href="https://www.netlify.com//">netlify </a> and sign in. click create site or something like this and it will ask you where you will want to run the site from. click github sign in and click the repo. 

# tips
<ol>1. to change the images just copy the file name of the existing image and rename it to the image you want. change the name of the original image so it doesnt refer to the original image in the code.
2. if you notice that a change hasnt been made its possible that you just need to wait. sometimes netlify takes very long to push updates but if you click open build deploy in the build logs you should see the changes
3. this runs on markdown syntax and the notetaking system is FOAM so learn FOAM to learn exocore</ol>
